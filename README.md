Machine Learning: Determining Risk of Suicide From Nocturnal Sleep Behavior

This project utilized machine learning classification techniques to examine the relationship between university students' poor sleep quality and possible association to risk of suicide. To view the full project report, please read the <b>Final Project Report</b> in this repository. 

The data used for this project is from <i>Assessing Nocturnal Sleep/Wake Effects on Risk of Suicide</i>, a study from the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). Only one team member (me) for this project had access to the data due to the security permissions granted by NSRR. Additionally, I cannot share the data used in this project on my GitHub, however the data is described in detail in the report.
